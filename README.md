<!-- PROJECT NAME -->
# CRIS Tools
A collection of bioinformatics tools used to analyze data generated using the CRSSANT/rna2d3d pipeline.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

Advancements in the field of RNA structure and interaction studies have enabled high throughput analysis of RNAs, revealing base pairing and higher order interactions. Despite the progress on the experimental methods for studying RNA secondary and intermolecular complexes, computational analysis of such data generated has remained a challenge. One subset of such experimental methods, the crosslinking- and proximity-ligation based approaches generates non-continuous reads that indicate specific RNA structures and interactions. Here, we provide a resource that details the results of the computational analysis from a variety of methods that employ the crosslinking-ligation principle (*see* [PARIS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27180905/), [PARIS2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22552-y), [SHARC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28602-3)).
